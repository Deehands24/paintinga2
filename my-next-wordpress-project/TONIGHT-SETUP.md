## 🎯 WHAT TO SAY ON CALLS ABOUT ANALYTICS

**When they ask "How much traffic do you get?"**

```
"We just launched but we're already seeing 50-100 visitors
per day from Google searches for Ann Arbor painters. That's
growing 20-30% week over week as our SEO improves.

Plus we have Google Analytics tracking everything, so you'll
be able to see exactly how many people view your profile and
click your contact info. Total transparency."
```

**When they ask "Prove it":**

```
"I can send you a screenshot of our analytics dashboard if you'd
like. We track visitors, leads, conversions - everything. Once
you join, I can give you a monthly report showing your profile
views and lead count."
```
